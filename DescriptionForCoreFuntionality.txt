In this build, you'll find that enemies can hunt down the player.
Some will stay in place and shoot towards the player.
There is a HUD where there is a goal to reach and a control layout for the player.
In that list of controls, the player can dash, jump, shoot, Make a charged jump, and stomp towards the ground with some special effects.
Other than that, everything is the same, just added more enemy AI and added some movement options for the player.
